ICCV 2025 is open. The accepted papers are on stage: **detection**, **tracking**, **vision-language models**, and **3D vision** dominate the program. This is the week when the ideas from the July accepted list become talks, posters, and conversations—and when the next round of trends gets set.

I’ve been tracking this cycle since the accepted list dropped. Seeing the same themes—multimodal fusion, efficient video, 3D from RGB, robustness—play out in the main conference confirms that the field is betting on **integration** (vision + language + action) and **deployment** (edge, efficiency, reliability). Here’s what to watch.

## What’s On the Program

**Detection and tracking**—from classic object detection to language-conditioned and multi-object tracking. The workshops added challenges and benchmarks; the main track has the methods that push state of the art.

**Vision-language models**—grounding, retrieval, reasoning, and hallucination reduction. If you’re building on VLMs, the talks and posters here are the ones that will influence the next generation of models.

**3D vision**—reconstruction, generative 3D, pose, and scene understanding. NeRF, Gaussian splatting, and diffusion for 3D are all represented. This is where “3D from images” and “3D generation” meet.

## Why It Matters

ICCV sets the tone for the next year. What gets attention in the halls and in the follow-up arXiv releases will shape funding, hiring, and product roadmaps. If you couldn’t make it, the Open Access repository and workshop pages are the next best thing: papers, slides, and challenge results in one place.

The official site is iccv.thecvf.com. Block some time, pick a track, and go deep. The field is moving fast—this is the snapshot.
