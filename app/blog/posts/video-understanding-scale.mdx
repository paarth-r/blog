At ICCV 2025, **video** isn’t just “a few seconds.” Multiple talks and papers focus on **long-horizon video modeling**, **sparse temporal sampling**, and **memory-efficient architectures** so we can understand hours, not just clips. That’s the difference between “what happened in this shot?” and “what’s the story of this video?”

I care about this for gesture and interaction: short clips give you gestures; long context gives you intent, fatigue, and narrative. The same architectural ideas—sparse attention, trajectory tokens, state-space compression—that make long video tractable also help real-time pipelines stay within memory and latency budgets. Here’s what’s in the ICCV spotlight.

## Long-Horizon and Sparse Temporal Sampling

You can’t run dense attention over every frame of a one-hour video. So we get **sparse sampling**—choose keyframes or segments—and **hierarchical** or **memory-bounded** models that summarize at one scale and reason at another. The talks at ICCV are making this concrete: which sampling strategies work, how to avoid losing critical moments, and how to keep inference cost under control.

## Memory-Efficient Architectures

**Memory-efficient** doesn’t just mean “smaller model.” It means **bounded memory** as sequence length grows: sliding windows, compressed memory banks, state-space models that don’t store full histories. Several ICCV papers push in this direction so that “long video” doesn’t require “datacenter GPU.”

## Where This Goes

Long-horizon video understanding will drive the next wave of applications: search, summarization, compliance, and narrative QA. The Open Access repository (openaccess.thecvf.com) has the full set of ICCV 2025 papers—filter by “video” or “temporal” and you’ll get the ones that define this direction.

If you’re working on video at any scale, those talks and papers are the roadmap. Scale in time is the next frontier.
