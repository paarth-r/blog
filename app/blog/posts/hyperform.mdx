title: "The Journey: Building my Startup as a High Schooler (Part 1)"
publishedAt: "2025-06-26"
summary: "This is the beginning of a raw, transparent series documenting what it’s like to build a software startup from scratch as a high school student. No fluff—just lessons, roadblocks, breakthroughs, and code."

Most startup stories are told in retrospect—after the exit, the acquisition, or the failure. This series is different. I’m writing this **as I go**, in real time, while building a SaaS product as a full-time high school student.

I’m not some overnight success. I’m not backed by YC or sitting on VC calls. I’m figuring this out between homework and robotics. This isn’t a guide. It’s a **field log**—for others who want to start something but haven’t seen someone like them doing it.

## What I’m Building: Hyperform

The startup is called **Hyperform**.

It’s a computer vision-based SaaS platform that helps people improve their form during workouts by giving **real-time feedback using their webcam**. It combines human pose estimation with biomechanical insight, powered by a SoTA transformer-based 2D-to-3D lifting model with temporal context. Hyperform lets users:

- Upload or stream a workout video  
- Get instant feedback on joint angles, posture, and reps  
- Track progress across time using metrics and charts  
- Share sessions with trainers or physical therapists

Think of it like a **smart mirror without the $2,000 price tag**—built for phones, laptops, and gym spaces where real coaching isn’t always available.

Long-term, I see Hyperform expanding into:

- Sports performance coaching  
- Physical therapy rehab tracking  
- Integration with wearables (Whoop, Apple Watch, etc.)

## Constraints I’m Working Under

- **Time** — Between school, sports, robotics, family—this project gets maybe 30-40 hours/week. How do I do it? My sleep schedule (or lack thereof)
- **Money** — ~$100/mo budget. Every SaaS tool or plugin has to earn its keep.  
- **Credibility** — I’m a teenager cold-emailing founders and devs. Some respond. Most don’t.  
- **Experience** — I’ve built projects, sure. But this is my first time thinking about pricing, auth flows, scaling, churn, and legal stuff.

## What’s Next (Part 2 Teaser)

Next up:

- Finishing the MVP with pose detection + frontend UI  
- Getting latency down under 200ms for real-time feedback  
- Validating feedback with a certified trainer  
- Building a killer landing page & app that speaks to athletes
