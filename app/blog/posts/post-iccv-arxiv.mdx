title: 'Post-ICCV arXiv Releases: Extended Experiments and Ablations'
publishedAt: '2025-11-01'
summary: 'Many ICCV 2025 papers are hitting arXiv with extended experiments and ablations. It’s the best time to read the full story behind the conference versions.'

Conference papers are condensed. The **full story** often lands on arXiv after the event. November is when a lot of **ICCV 2025** work shows up on arXiv with **extended experiments**, **ablations**, and **supplementary results** that didn’t fit in the page limit. If you only read the conference version, you’re missing the best part.

I use this wave to go deeper: which design choices actually mattered, how methods compare under different settings, and what failed. That’s how you turn “cool paper” into “I could use this.” The November cs.CV arXiv list is where to look. Here’s how I approach it.

## What to Look For in the Extended Versions

**Ablations**—which components drive the gain? Sparse attention vs. full? This loss vs. that? The extended versions usually break it down so you can strip or adapt parts for your setting.

**Broader evaluation**—more datasets, more baselines, more metrics. That’s where you see if a method is a one-dataset trick or actually generalizes.

**Failure cases and limitations**—often in the appendix or extended draft. Knowing where a method breaks is as important as knowing where it wins.

## How I Use the November List

I keep a shortlist of ICCV papers that are relevant to my work (gesture, AR, efficiency, 3D). When the arXiv versions drop, I read those first. Then I skim the rest of the November cs.CV list for anything that might transfer. It’s the most efficient way to catch up after a big conference.

If you’re tracking the 2025 vision cycle, block some time in November for arxiv.org/list/cs.CV/2025-11. The post-ICCV wave is the full picture.
