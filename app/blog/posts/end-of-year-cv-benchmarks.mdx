By late December, the year’s models are in. So are the **benchmarks** designed to summarize and **stress-test** them: new datasets, new metrics, and consolidated evaluations that ask “how did 2025 vision models really do?” It’s report card season—and the best time to see which ideas held up and which were overfit to the old benchmarks.

I use these benchmarks to decide what to build on in the new year. If a model family does well on the full suite—accuracy, robustness, efficiency, fairness—it’s a candidate for production. If it only wins on one narrow task, I treat it as a tool, not a foundation. Here’s what to watch in the end-of-year releases.

## What Usually Drops

**Consolidated benchmarks**—one evaluation that spans multiple tasks (classification, detection, segmentation, retrieval) so you can compare “generalist” models on the same footing.

**Stress tests**—corruption, domain shift, long-tail, and OOD so we see where models break, not just where they shine.

**Efficiency leaderboards**—accuracy vs. latency, accuracy vs. params, so we can choose the right model for the right device.

## How I Use Them

I skim the new benchmark papers first: what’s the protocol, what’s the data, what’s the metric? Then I look at which 2025 models rank where. That gives me a shortlist for the next project. The December cs.CV list (arxiv.org/list/cs.CV/2025-12) is where most of this lands. Block some time between the holidays and New Year’s—it’s the best reading of the quarter.
